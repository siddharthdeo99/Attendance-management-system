![Dashboard](ovfjnhttps://i.ibb.co/cxpzpSK/Attendance-Management-System-Project-In-Java-Student-Information.webp "Admin Dashboard")
This project is a Java Swing-based application for managing attendance records in schools and colleges.

# Project Outline ☘ #
The Attendance Management System is designed to automate the process of recording and managing student attendance. The system allows teachers or administrators to record attendance by taking students' fingerprints, scanning barcodes, or using other biometric or identification technologies. The system then stores the attendance data in a secure database that can be accessed by authorized personnel.

# Project Working 🎋 #
The application allows users to:

* Add new students to the database
* Record attendance using biometric or identification technologies
* View attendance records for each student
* Generate automated reports for parents
* Manage staff attendance and payroll reports

# How to Run the Project ✨ #
